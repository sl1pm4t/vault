## Confirm
`Confirm` components prevent users from performing actions they do not intend to by showing a confirmation message as an overlay. This is a contextual component that should always be rendered with a `Trigger` which triggers the message.

See the `Trigger` component for a description of properties.

**Example**
  
```js
<div class="box">
  <Confirm as |c|>
    <c.Trigger
      @id={{item.id}}
      @onTrigger={{action c.onTrigger item.id}}
      @triggerText="Delete"
      @message="This will permanently delete this secret and all its vesions."
      @onConfirm={{action "delete" item "secret"}}
      />
  </Confirm>
</div>
```
